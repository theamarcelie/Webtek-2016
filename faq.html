				<h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<div class="faq_question">
				<h1> How durable is the material?</h1>
				<p>
				During the tanning process the material becomes extremely tough and durable. 
				It will withstand damages both in the form of scratches and tears. It’s important to keep it out of direct 
				sunlight for long periods though, because like other skin products it can be susceptible to bleaching and 
				cracking caused by sunlight.
				</p>

			<div class="faq_question">
				<h1> How can i clean products made with fish skin?</h1>
				<p>
				Salmon skin is naturally durable against staining. We recommend using a cloth with water, or if needed water
				with some light detergent. This is an efficient method against most stains. You should not use any heavy detergents 
				to clean the products, as this may cause discoloring and other types of damage to the product. If water and light 
				detergent doesn’t remove the stain you should rather contact a professional cleaning agency. 
				</p>

			<div class="faq_question">
				<h1> How do i preserve products made with fish skin?</h1>
				<p>
				Products made of fish skin will last you a lifetime with the right care. We recommend occasionally using leather 
				conditioner to moisturise the skin, which will keep it from drying out and cracking.

			<div class="faq_question">
				<h1> Can i buy products from this site? </h1>
				<p>
				We aren’t currently producing any products, and are still at the research fase of the project. But we hope to start
				making designs as soon as possible, and get our great ideas out to the market!
