				<h1>Environment</h1>
				<p>
				Norway has a booming Salmon Industry, which was valued to around 
				<a href = "https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiskeoppdrett#Oppdrett_av_laksefisker">50 billion NOK in 2015.</a>
				 But this industry is almost solely based on the production of meat from the salmon, and 
				a lot of potential resources from the fish, like the skin, is seen as waste. There is always
				room for improvement, and we think that the industry should start to utilize the full 
				potential of the resource they are producing.
				<br>
				<br>
				The production of salmon is not especially environmentally harmful in itself, at least when
				you compare it with beef from cattle, which emits about 
				<a href = "https://laksefakta.no/laks-og-miljo/hvordan-pavirker-oppdrettslaksen-klimautslippene/"> 12 times as much CO2 than salmon pr kg.</a>
				 What this means is that we have a great opportunity to cut large amounts of CO2 emissions,
				if only more leather products were made with the skin from salmon rather than cattle.
				<br>
				<br>
				But what about the tanning process itself? It is true that it requires a selection of different
				chemicals to transform the product from skin to leather. But by using biodegradable chemicals, 
				and making sure that not a single drop of harmful chemicals finds its way into nature, we hope 
				to make the process as environmentally friendly as possible. When it comes to CO2-emissions, 
				the tanning process is relatively friendly, as it only releases a fraction of the emissions that
				the
