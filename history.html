			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>This page will have the same layout as the environment.html page; a picture above a paragraph. Environment.jpg will show an example of fish leather from earlier times. The goal of this page is to inform about fish leather throughout the history, so that the observer will understand that it is far from something new, risky and unethical - but indeed a tradition of craftsmanship and high quality.</p>
