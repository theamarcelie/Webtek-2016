    <h2>P4 Project Testing</h2>

    <h2>Administrative details</h2>
    <p>The client, Peder Holm, is the CEO of ecoFishLeather</p>
  
    <h2>Testing Document</h2>
    <p>The questionnaire we sent out was primarily to get feedback on the userability, content and over-all layout. 
      We used google form, and divided the questionnaire into three parts. The first part is about the testers age and occupation, 
      including the device and browser they used. Part two is about the content, and part three is about the layout and userability.</p>

    <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    <p>The autented audience are innovative companies and individuals interested in collaborating and getting fish leather on the market, 
      or just simply people with an environmental concern. However, the audience we managed to get on our questionnaire were roughly 81% 
      college students, 4% school administrators and 15% others. We had 4 live observations and interviews, whereas 1 was with a school 
      administrator at IPD, and the rest with students from IPD. On the questionnaire, 22 people answered, 18 of them students aged 18-29,
      and 4 (the rest) were in the age group 30-39, not students. Therefore, part of the tester audience was innovative individuals, 
      as all our live testers were from IPD, including the school administrator. Most of the testers also described themselves as 
      environmentally concerned, and gave positive feedback on the concept.</p>
    
    <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
    <p>All of the 4 live observations were using a MacBook Pro 13" on google chrome, since we were providing them with a computer 
      they could test on. However, on the questionnaire, 32% (7/22) of the testers were on their phone, and 68% (15/22) were using 
      a computer. Of the 32% mobile testers, 71% had an iPhone, and 29% had an android phone. Of the 68% computer testers, 33% had a 
      macBook Pro, and 67% had a pc.Regarding browsers, MORE TEXT</p>
  
    <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
    <p>On content, almost everyone thought the purpose of the page was to inform about fish leather and promote environmental design, 
      and that the page is about design and fish leather. Most also thought the autented audience are designers, and some thought it was
      companies. We got very positive feedback on the userability (we have the smart phone-navbar at this point right?). About half
      thought the picture carousel was "very nice", and the rest said it was nice/okay. Regarding layout and design, we got very positive
      feedback on the color choices, but no so much on the fonts readibility - some found it a bit hard to read.</p>
  
    <h2>Our Response</h2>
    <p>If we had more time to perfect the website, we would have spent more time on the CSS document, especially the media queries to 
      make the site more responsive. We did not manage to find an elegant solution to make the “tiles” (six small images) look good,
      and at the same time be compatible with media queries and the js to resize them. If there had been more time available, we would 
      probably have found a solution to make them appear in pairs as the screen is scaled down and then in a single line as the screen 
      approaches smartphone width. We also got some feedback that it was frustrating that one could not click anywhere outside the picture
      frame to exit the resize carousel, the users would prefer that to having to click on the X in the corner. On mobile phones, we would
      have spent more time optimizing the site for mobile phones as this is probably the prefered device in our user group. </p>
  
    <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
    <p>We learned the importance of making a detailed plan and distributing tasks, so everyone could contribute at all times. We also 
      learnt that communication really is key, and that by working together we avoid stupid errors that occurs when people assign the 
      same element with different names. We also waited a long time before we fully implemented Github into our work, and we didn’t
      spend as much time as we probably should getting familiar with Github and its different functionalities. We also could have done
      a better job documenting changes throughout the process, because at the end we had to look back to find out what exactly had bee
      n changed, and we would have saved ourselves a bit of work if we had written the changes underways. We also wrote down the changes
      in different documents, which further made things harder than they needed to be.
