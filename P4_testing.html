    <h2>Administrative details</h2>
    <p>The client, Peder Holm, is the CEO of ecoFishLeather</p>
  
    <h2>Testing Document</h2>
    <p>The questionnaire we sent out was primarily to get feedback on the userability, content and over-all layout. 
      We used google form, and divided the questionnaire into three parts. The first part is about the testers age and occupation, 
      including the device and browser they used. Part two is about the content, and part three is about the layout and userability.</p>

    <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    <p>The autented audience are innovative companies and individuals interested in collaborating and getting fish leather on the market, 
      or just simply people with an environmental concern. However, the audience we managed to get on our questionnaire were roughly 81% 
      college students, 4% school administrators and 15% others. We had 4 live observations and interviews, whereas 1 was with a school 
      administrator at IPD, and the rest with students from IPD. On the questionnaire, 22 people answered, 18 of them students aged 18-29,
      and 4 (the rest) were in the age group 30-39, not students. Therefore, part of the tester audience was innovative individuals, 
      as all our live testers were from IPD, including the school administrator. Most of the testers also described themselves as 
      environmentally concerned, and gave positive feedback on the concept.</p>
    
    <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
    <p>All of the 4 live observations were using a MacBook Pro 13" on google chrome, since we were providing them with a computer 
      they could test on. However, on the questionnaire, 32% (7/22) of the testers were on their phone, and 68% (15/22) were using 
      a computer. Of the 32% mobile testers, 71% had an iPhone, and 29% had an android phone. Of the 68% computer testers, 33% had a 
      macBook Pro, and 67% had a pc.Regarding browsers, MORE TEXT</p>
  
    <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
    <p>On content, almost everyone thought the purpose of the page was to inform about fish leather and promote environmental design, 
      and that the page is about design and fish leather. Most also thought the autented audience are designers, and some thought it was
      companies. We got very positive feedback on the userability (we have the smart phone-navbar at this point right?). About half
      thought the picture carousel was "very nice", and the rest said it was nice/okay. Regarding layout and design, we got very positive
      feedback on the color choices, but no so much on the fonts readibility - some found it a bit hard to read.</p>
  
    <h2>Our Response</h2>
    <p>What we would to to improve our page based on the feedback</p>
  
    <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
    <p>We learnt the importance of making a detailed plan and distributing tasks, so everyone could contribute at all times. We also 
      learnt that communication really is key, and that by working together we avoid stupid errors that occures when people assign the 
      same element with different names.</p>
