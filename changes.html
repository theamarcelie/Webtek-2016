	<h1>Changes</h1>
    <h5>17.10.2016: Sigurd drops out of the project</h5>
    <h5>17.10.2016: Project continue in much faster pace from now</h5>
	<h5>Carrousel 1 and 2 have been made into one js //need alt if carrousel doesnt work? </h5>
    <p>We originally planned 8 pages and 4 js-files, but even though we removed blog.html, blog.js and carousel2.js, we met the minimum criteria by adding contact.html, faq.js and navbar.js. However, most of the changes are small and incremental, and exists for the pure goal of reaching a high level of userability and user experience.</p>
    
    <p><em>Client change:</em> Sigurd dropped out of the project, which led to all images and text related to Sigurd being removed. This led making a big change in about.html.</p>
    
    <p><em>New structure of maps:</em> “scripts” was renamed “script”, and “images” -> “img”.</p>
    
    <p><em>Changes in home.html: </em>renamed “index.html”.</p>
    
    <p><em>Changes in the navbar:</em>"Home" has been replaced with logo.png; a logo of a fish, because this improves the design of the webpage, and enhances the over-all goal of the page: to promote and get the user interested in salmon skin as a material. We also made the text more centered on the navigation bar, for aesthetic reasons only. Another change in the navbar is that we added an intuitive signifier so that the user will know which page he/she is on. This signifier is 
</p>

<p><em>Changes to about.html:</em>the two-column vertical descriptions of Sigurd and Peder, with a picture on top, have been changed to a single horisontal column, about Peder. This change was made because Sigurd dropped out of the project, but luckily made it easier for us to code. In the navbar, under "About", "Team" has been changed to "Peder".
</p>

<p><em>Changes to materials.html:</em> history.jpg is now on the left side of the column, such that environment.jpg and history.jpg is aligned. This change was made because early user feedback told us it was confusing that the two columns (environment and history) were opposites. Another change is that we made the images responsive, to enhance the fact that they do something. The image tiles and the environment.jpg and history.jpg, will, if hovered, get a transparency.
</p>

<p><em>Changes to blog.html:</em>we removed the whole page because it didn't require any js-coding, like we earlier thought, and because the client didn't find it necessary to have a blog in addition to social media.
</p>

<p><em>Changes in inspiration.html:</em>the six image tiles are more responsive, and if hovered on, will become more transparent.</p>

<p><em>Changes in faq.html:</em>added js to make the page responsive and more stylish. Instead of faq.html being a plain text page, it now has clickable buttons that, if clicked, reveals helpful answers.
</p>

<p><em>Added contact.html:</em>some of our testers had trouble finding contact information despite the footer being at the bottom; so to fullfill the goal of getting potential customers, we made a new page entirely to make sure companies/individuals could contact Peder. This page consists of a column with laksebenk.jpg and a text box with contact information. The overall layout, including font attributes and margins, is the same as in the other pages.</p>

<p><em>Changes in CSS styling:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>margins: left/right margin is now 10%, and margins between columns is 5%</li>
<li>images: always placed left</li>
<li>salmon color has been changed to #FF8C69</li>
<li>links have salmon color </li>
<li>active elements in navbar have salmon color</li>
<li>onhover-elements have salmon color</li>
<li>onhover-elements in dropdown-menu also have a dark grey background</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Changes in carousel1.js and carousel2.js:</em>these are now the same: carrousel.js. We removed the buttons from carrousel.js, since it interrupted the rythm of the image flow, and because the pictures easily can be accessed right below the image carrousel. By removing the buttons, we simplified the carrousel and removed a possible source of frustration, hopefully giving the user a better user experience. Another change is that Idun also joined in and cooperated on the code.</p>

<p><em>Changes in resize.js:</em> in addition to blowing up small tumbnail pictures, it can now let the user click through all the blown up thumbnail pictures. We did this to add functionality and reduce frustration that could occur when the user had to click to see the picture in a larger format, then exit to get access to the other pictures, and then click again to see the next picture in a larger format. We have also added some more responsiveness to the images, so they will appear transparent when hovered on. This is to make sure the user understands that the image can be clicked, and that something will happen. We also added more content to the resize.js in the inspiration.html page. If clicked, the picture will not only have a larger format, but also display more text.</p>

<p><em>Changes in blog.js: </em>removed, because blog.html was removed.</p>

<p><em>Added navbar.js:</em>Navbar.js was implemented to make the website more responsive. On smaller screens or smartphones, the navigation bar is replaced with a hamburger icon (three lines). The javascript enables the user to click on the icon to get the navigation bar as a vertical list instead of the horizontal one that is visible on larger devices.    
</p>

<p><em>Added faq.js:</em>added js to make the page responsive and more stylish. Instead of faq.html being a plain text page, it now has clickable buttons that, if clicked, reveals helpful answers.</p>

<p><em>Changes in pictures:</em>“Icon.ico” is now “logo.png”. Hvilke bilder er endret?</p>

<p><em>Changes in @media in CSS to adapt to other devices:</em>We did not have an initial plan for media queries or how the site should look on various devices, aside from the fact that we wanted a responsive website. We noticed that the computers in the computer labs are larger than most laptops, so we made the font sizes larger and the margins wider so the site would look better on wide screens.


User tests showed that the original site was not very compatible with smartphones, so we adapted changes in the CSS to meet these demands. For the mobile solution, we made the navbar larger and adapted it to better fit smaller screens, we also made the font size bigger for better readability. The margins were set to 1% to save screen space. The structure is more vertical for smartphones, with the text places under the image.</p>
